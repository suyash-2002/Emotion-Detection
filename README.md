# Emotion Detection Using Multi-Modal Data and Deep Learning

## Abstract

Emotion detection is a crucial aspect of affective computing, enabling applications to understand and respond to human emotions effectively. This research project focuses on developing an emotion detection model using multi-modal data, including facial expressions, text-based data, and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The proposed model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Bidirectional LSTM neural networks to capture the complex patterns in each modality. The study achieves promising results, with facial emotion detection achieving an accuracy of 82.79%, text-based emotion detection reaching 93.3% accuracy, and EEG emotion detection achieving 91.27% accuracy. The integration of multi-modal data enhances the overall emotion detection accuracy. This report provides a detailed overview of the research methodology, model architectures, training processes, and performance evaluations for each modality.
